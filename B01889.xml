         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Free Butchers OF THE City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Free-Butchers</hi> which reſide without the Liberty of the City, are obliged by Reaſon of want of Room, and the Rents being dear in the City, to take Houſes in the Out-parts for their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iency of Killing, <hi>&amp;c</hi> And keep the Markets in the ſaid City to vend the ſame, and have no other Place to do it in.</p>
            <p>AND for the better Ordering and Regulating of the ſeveral Markets in the ſaid City, there are Inſtructions in an Act of Common-Council, made in the Maioralty of Sir <hi>William Hooker,</hi> late Lord Mayor of the ſaid City; perſuant to which Act, there is a Time appointed for Foreigners or Countery People to bring their Proviſions to ſell in the ſaid Markets, which is four Days of the Week only: But for want of proper Officers to Inſpect the Markets, they uſe the Markets every Day of the Week, and ſo break thro' that Clauſe of the aforeſaid Act, that fixes the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Days, and likewiſe every other Clauſe thereof, to the great Prejudice of the Citizens, who pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bear Scot and Lot for all the Charges that are required by this Antient City, to ſupport the Grandure thereof.</p>
            <p>THAT there are great Numbers of Perſons that come up to Town as Labourers, who get into ſome Place where they learn a little inſight of the Trade, and after that they come and ſell Meat every Day in the City, and claim as much Right under the Farmers of the Markets as a Perſon ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeven Years to the Trade, and others that ſerve part of their Time, and upon a Non-Inrolment, or Death of their Maſter ſets up the Trade as if they had duly ſerved their Time.</p>
            <p>THAT the <hi>Butchers,</hi> or thoſe that call themſelves ſo, which daily uſe the Markets are not Countrey People, but Perſons that live in and about <hi>Shoreditch, Cowcroſs, Swan-Alley-</hi> the back of <hi>Grays-Inn Lane,</hi> and divers Places Adjacent to the City, of which many have ſerved their Time, but will not take up their Freedoms of the City, having the enjoyment of the ſame Privilege as the Citizens themſelves.</p>
            <p>THAT, for the Reaſons aforeſaid, the Company as well as the City ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, for none Cares to bind or take up their Freedoms, having no more Privilege than a Foreigner; Whereas there is now many hundreds that would either buy their Freedoms, or take them up.</p>
            <p>THAT the King, City, and Company looſe their ſeveral Duties and Fees, and the Orphans ſuffer in the Duty apropriated for them likewiſe.</p>
            <p>NOW, if the Citizens and Freemen of <hi>London</hi> had the Privilege of abiding in the City-Markets (they having, as is above obſerved, no other Place to uſe their Trade in) to diſpoſe and ſell their Proviſions but the two Days called By-days ſeperate from the Foreigners, who, according to the aforeſaid Act of Common-Council are both excluded ſelling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions on theſe two Days, then all that had a Right would gladly take up their Freedoms, by which means both King, City, Company, and Orphans would have their Dutyes, Dues and Taxes ſecured; Likewiſe the Farmers of the Markets would find their Intereſt in it. And alſo the Inhabitants of this Great and Populous City would be ſupplyed with as great if not greater Plenty of all ſorts of wholſome Fleſh, and at as Cheap a Rate, if not Cheaper than now it can be conveyed to them. But under the preſent Dilemma, moſt Perſons are indifferent, they will not bind Apprentices or take up their Freedoms when out of their Time.</p>
            <p>N. B. <hi>The Perſons complain'd of in this Caſe are ſo numerouſe, that they have frequent Meetings to collect and ſubſcribe Money to oppoſe Juſtice in any Paoſecution on the ſeveral Heads aforeſaid, and for want of proper Penalties a Proſecution is Inefectual.</hi>
